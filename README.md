# Social Network

## Description

The social network app lays out the foundation for the back end of a social media site.  The sight offers schema designs for users, thoughts and reactions.  Users have a username, email, a list of thoughts, a friends list and a running count of the number of friends they have.  Thoughts have a text field, a username, a date stamp, and a reactions list with a counter.  Both users and thoughts perform CRUD operations with the ability to get all, get by id, update, create, or delete.  There are also routes to be able to add or remove friends from a user's friend list.  The reactions have a username, body and date stamp and endpoints to create new ones or delete existing ones.
